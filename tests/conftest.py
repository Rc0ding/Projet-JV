# This file must be named 'conftest.py' and be located in the 'tests/' directory.
# It gets loaded automatically by pytest to provide "fixtures" available to all tests.
# In our context, it allows test functions to require a `window: arcade.Window`
# argument (the name is meaningful!). It will be the one and only Window used
# for testing. Tests are not allowed to create their own Window.
# We copied this from the arcade open source repository, and simplified it
# because we do not need all their configurations.

# You should not modify this file, and you do not need to understand what it does.
