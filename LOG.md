### Week 1 
lol working in week 1?
### Week 2
During week 2, we mainly focused on revisiting our Python basics that were now distant. Happy to see that they came back faster than expected, no further significant progress was made, outside of the hassle of geting sorted with git. We had set it up on the VMs of EPFL, and quickly realized that we'd be coding from our respective homes, thus we redid the whole installation on our personal devices.
### Week 3 
During week 3, we tried to take some organization measures, preemptively fighting our procrastinating tendencies: we created a shared Goodnotes notebook as a common place to sketch our ideas and keep a To Do List up to date. We also got Arcade to run and played around with the library in order to grasp how and what objects interact with each other.
### Week 4
Remi was inspired to take on the blobs and Noah liked the idea of map generation from text files. We indeed had drawn the maps at first on our Goodnotes notebook and this was a way to see them come to life. This week has seen the birth of our main.py, gameview.py, and the once alone mapgen.py that was unaware of polymorphism and supposed to generate maps on its own. it was not finished then but the ideas were there, and although we knew we were starting to run a little late, we felt confident that we'd catch up the next week.
### Week 5
This week marked a good accomplishement in the completion and correctess of both blobs and mapgen, that were now fully functionning and operating.
We had just seen what polymporphism was through the tutorials, and quickly understood that everything we had done would have to be redesigned and this widely set us back motivation-wise
### Week 6
We felt that weeks were piling up fast, and had spent a lot of time studying POO, thus we caught up on the other courses of our bachelor. Motivation was low too, as our classmates were all saying that the project's tasks take ages to finish and really aren't easy. 
### Week 7
We knew we couldn't let another week on zero progress go by like that, Remi had done what Noah thought to be the most complex module by then (blobs) so Noah volunteered to code the sword. It shaped up to be quite a challenge, as the "easy entry level" display of a sword was visually repelling: spinning around the center of the sprite that was the blade, and would be kept in only one hand. Noah wasn't satisfied with that, and promised himself to work more on it the next week and polish the look.
### Week 8 
Noah implemented two functionnalities in the sword system : a rotation point being the player's hand, and a offset vector, being the vector denoting of the distance between the center of the sword's sprite and the visually pleasing center of rotation being the handle. This logic could now we replicated with simple math and flipped on the other side of the luckily relatively symetrical player. During that time, Remi started refactoring and thinking deeper about the gameplan regarding the polymorphisms and how the general mapping of events and items should behave in our project.
### Week 9
Studied for the midterm, no progress was made.
### Week 10
We felt like we were running late on a lot of topics, and motivation hit a new low. We thought the project looked like all of the other ones, as we would often see a cloud of cornflower blue screens light up and play in unisson between lectures. We didn't want our project to be a carbon copy of all the others, but didn't know what to do about it. We started working on the bats, and ideas flourished in our minds.
### Week 11
We learnt about the requirement of having a personal adition to the project, and discussed what they could be. We wanted our character to have a health bar, and coded that immediately. Now blobs wouldn't have our hero vanish, but have a knockback in a direction and lower its health bar. This sparked yet an other idea, that would replenish our motivation plenty, since we still had weeks to catch-up on: we were going to be using our designin skills to create textures for every block/item displayed on our screen to have a brand new visual identity. This in fact is how Remi and Noah met, through their interest in design and posters, so it only made sense that we'd implement that too.
### Week 12
Designing roughly 20 sprites by hand is no joke, and it took quite some time, but our motivation was sky high. We felt like the redesign wasn't that much about coding and that we might be missing the mark, and we decided to add yet something else: a weapon upgrade. The player could now pick up an item on the map and upgrade its sword, granting him more range. The idea behind that was twofold: more range equals more protection against mobs, and also the ability to reach through a 1 block thick wall to activate a switch. This was enough to get us to finish the content of the course: Noah coded the bow and arrows as well as the weapon upgrade, and Remi took care of the switches and moving platforms.
### Week 13
The whole code was finished, but we absolutely needed some refactoring. We thought about the ideal way of identifying all the items in our game, and rebuilt everything from the ground up. We really felt the power of coding and of polymorphisms there, as this process took suprisingly little time compared to what we expected. We also polished the textures and sprites of our redesign: Remi is a good drawer and Noah has worked with Photoshop professionnally, we were able to create a lot of satisfactory sprites in a week.
### Week 14
Surprised to see that our project was coming to completion relatively well, we spent this time polishing our code, writing tests and designing maps, probably the most fun we've had with the project; we felt like Daedalus crafting his legendary maze.
